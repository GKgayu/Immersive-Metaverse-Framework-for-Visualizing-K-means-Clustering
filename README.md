# Immersive-Metaverse-Framework-for-Visualizing-K-means-Clustering
Overview:  This repository contains the anonymized dataset, source code, and supplementary teaching materials used in the study “An Immersive Metaverse Framework for Visualizing K-means Clustering in ML Education”. The resources are provided to support reproducibility and to help educators adapt the framework to their own classrooms.
Contents

/code/
Python/Unity scripts for implementing the immersive visualization of the k-means algorithm.
Includes clustering logic, 3D point generation, and VR environment setup.

/data/
Anonymised sample datasets used to demonstrate k-means clustering (small synthetic datasets suitable for classroom use).

/materials/

Instructor guidelines (implementation steps, classroom setup notes).

Student activity sheets (guided exercises for learning k-means).

Handouts explaining clustering steps and convergence criteria.

/figures/
Screenshots and illustrative diagrams showing the immersive environment and clustering iterations.

equirements

VR headset (e.g., Meta Quest series) — optional for testing; simulations can also run in desktop mode.

Python 3.10 or later.

Unity version [insert version number].

Required Python libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

How to Reproduce

Clone or download the repository.

Open the /code/ folder and follow the setup instructions in INSTALL.md.

Use the datasets in /data/ for running the k-means simulations.

Instructors may use /materials/ to guide student activities.
